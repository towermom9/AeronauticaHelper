## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **AeronauticaHelper** – your all-in-one AFK automation companion for [Aeronautica](https://www.roblox.com/games/6647962258/UPD-Aeronautica), the ship/aircraft simulator on Roblox. Whatever your feelings are about AeroHelper, throw them out the window! Everything is different!

This is not an exploit, nor malware. It's fully **open source**, and functions by:
- Taking a **screenshot**
- Processing it with **OCR**
- Extracting values using **regex**
- Simulating **human-like mouse and keyboard actions**

## 🧾 Features

### 🚢 Boat AutoPilot

Boat AutoPilot allows you to AFK full job cycles by:
- Refueling
- Performing turnaround maintenance
- Accepting the highest-paying job
- Starting the boat
- Steering the ship
- Ending the route
- Repeating

It currently supports select routes between airports that allow straight-line navigation.
<details><summary>🌍 Supported Boat Routes</summary>

**Long-Haul:**
- Leovetsk ⇄ Tikaranto
- Leovetsk ⇄ Auchenburgh
- Eisenhardt Municipal ⇄ Auchenburgh
- Nordspyd ⇄ Norman
- Nordspyd ⇄ Udyanapura
- Kapa ⇄ Hipe
- Umibutsu ⇄ Hipe
- Tenera Palm ⇄ Nordspyd

**Express:**
- Leovetsk ⇄ Kitesboro
- Rawaki ⇄ Harden
- Rawaki ⇄ Amaras

</details>

### 🛩️ Airship AutoPilot

This works similarly to the Boat AutoPilot but includes altitude control. After the airship is spawned via AutoPilot, it will first rise to 500 feet above the terrain below. Then, it will ascend to a user-defined altitude above sea level. Once the airship is 10 nautical miles from its destination, it will descend to 100 feet above the terrain.

- **Nordspyd ⇄ Valois**

##

🕧 "Start AutoPilot Mid Mission" briefly skips the vehicle spawning sequence once.
##

### 🧭 AutoSteer
Lines up your vehicle to match a target **bearing**. Uses OCR to calculate angle difference and applies smart turns via keypresses.

> Especially useful when navigating through multiple waypoints or tight paths. **Customize Aeronautica's in-game flight plan, and AeroHelper will follow the path!** (assuming this [issue](https://github.com/SSkipr/AeronauticaHelper/issues/10) is resolved)

##

### 💥AutoRejoin (\Relaunch)
Disconnected? Roblox crash? No worries – AeroHelper detects this and will:
- Quit the Roblox application
- Rejoin and continue the job at hand

##

### 📢 Webhook Alerts

Sends alerts through your webhook when:
- Disconnected
- Crashed
- Fuel low/depleted
- Collision or obstruction
- OCR issues
- ETC

Critical alerts get an `@everyone` ping. Optional debug alerts can be toggled in the app under 'Verbose Notifications'.
